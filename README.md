## 📣 Project Description

_Throw Color_ is a project using Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS that returns five prominent colors from any uploaded image. There is no server attached with this project. Everything happens locally. So the data is safe.

## 👕 Project Inspiration

The inspiration of the project was a lazy weekend and a curious mind. I wanted to try something new with Vue.js, so started working on this and built this in two days(or two nights).

## 👑 What I Learnt

This project specifically helped me learn about event buses and the new features of Vue 3. Vue 3 has changed in a lot of way and this was a good opportunity for me to get my hands dirty with it.

## 🎏 Furure Plan

I've a plan to add a color pallete generator with this and also to show the recent generated palettes. Currently, it only copies the _hex_ values of the colors. I'll try to show other color codes as soon as I get time.
